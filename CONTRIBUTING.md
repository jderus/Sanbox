# Background
I have a professional background in .Net development. I have learned these technologies through the lens of ASP.NET and MS-assisted tech. With this repo, I am trying to get back to my roots and learn (hands-on) how to solve problems without MS Build/Dev/Test tech.

I would eventually like to convert this repo into a Yo Generator one day if it is valuable.

# Contribute
If you have somehow stumbled upon this repo, please feel free to contribute in the form of issues or PRs as suggestions/improvements. I want to learn - I value discourse and *constructive criticism*.

What is most important to me is why we think differently, and how we can bridge that gap in a mutually beneficial way.

Oh, and please ... Be Awesome. ;)
